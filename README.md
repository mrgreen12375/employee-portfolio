# employee-portfolio

## Discription 

This prodject was to create a webpage portfolio for future employers to see other prodject I have done. To build this web site I had to use the techniques learned in the last advance css module. In this prodject I used links in header to drop down to specific areas on the page. On those same links I gave them hover styles. To position certain objects I used position styles. For the images I used flexbox models and bordering. I created personal image of myself with an about me discription. For the contact me section I made hyperlinks for the corrasponding list items. With all of these techniqes combine I was able to make a responsive website portfolio.
